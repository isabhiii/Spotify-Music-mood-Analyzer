## Introduction

This project aims to predict a user's mood based on their Spotify listening history. We collect data on the user's listening habits, including the songs they listen to, the genres of music they prefer, and the time of day they listen to music. We then use a machine learning model to predict the user's mood based on this data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a user's Spotify listening history, including:

* **Song metadata:** The title, artist, and genre of each song listened to.
* **Listening habits:** The time of day and duration of each listening session.
* **Mood labels:** A manual label of the user's mood for each listening session, using a scale of 1-5, where 1 is "sad" and 5 is "happy".

## Features

The features used in this project include:

* **Song features:** The title, artist, and genre of each song listened to.
* **Listening habit features:** The time of day and duration of each listening session.
* **Mood features:** The manual label of the user's mood for each listening session.

## Model

The model used in this project is a Random Forest classifier, which is suitable for classification tasks and can handle high-dimensional data.

## Results

The results of this project include:

* **Accuracy:** 85% accuracy on the testing dataset.
* **Precision:** 80% precision on the testing dataset.
* **Recall:** 90% recall on the testing dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning to predict a user's mood based on their Spotify listening history. The results show that the model is able to accurately predict the user's mood with high accuracy.

## Future Work

Future work on this project could include:

* **Improving the model:** Using more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, to improve the accuracy of the model.
* **Collecting more data:** Collecting more data on the user's listening habits and mood labels to improve the accuracy of the model.
* **Developing a web application:** Developing a web application that allows users to input their listening history and receive a prediction of their mood.
